First kubectl create secret generic backend-password --from-literal=backend-pass='thisisatestthing.' was done to create a secretKeyRef that could be used
to give a value to MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD in the areas where needed such as
db-deployment.yaml and django-deploy.yaml which had to be modified respectively
to access this secret instead of directly accessing password. In addition, settings.py
was modified to access the secret instead of directly getting the value from the os.
This was done using some functions in python which were imported from kubernetes.
