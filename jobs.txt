The first things done were comment out the section of the dockerfile in the db folder which said to perform
setup.sql and separate the migrating part and the seeding part of setup.sql into migrate.sql
and seed.sql respectively. Running these sql files were then placed in the files named
migrate_db.yaml and seed_bd.yaml respectively to perform them as two separate kubernetes
jobs.
The docker file in the db folder was then also modified to copy over these new files
which were made as it would not automatically have them. After this the docker can be run
again (docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3-db:v0 db/) along with the migrating job (kubectl apply -f migrate_db.yaml) and the seeding job (kubectl apply -f seed_db.yaml) so as to better migrate
and seed the database. Thus this helps erase the issue of destroying the MYSQL pod in order
to perform changes to the database.
